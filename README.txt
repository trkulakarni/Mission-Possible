*hack3.py is the main code containing the program which Raspberry Pi 3B runs.
*LDR3.ino is Arduino code for sensing Light intensity, process it and ping the Raspberry Pi 3B.
*PIR3.ino is Arduino code for motion detection, process it and ping the Raspberry Pi 3B.  PIR - Passive Infrared Sensor
*SMOKE3.ino is Arduino code for smoke detection and local processing. It alos pings Raspberry Pi 3B.

For configuring Raspberry Pi for Google Assistant and for using Microsoft Azure a lot of commands were run and libraries were downloaded too.
